This is an app designed to put old technology to work. Rather than having an old computer sit un-used in your basement, 
you can place it in a common area of the house, and hook it up to this app.

It allows the computer to show either the weather outside, a photo slideshow, or a view of the day's calendar. 

For aesthetics, no keyboard or mouse is required to operate the app. Users can connect their smart phone to the same wifi network
as the computer, and they can use a virtual "remote" on their smartphone to direct what content appears on the computer.
