This is an app designed to put old technology to work. Rather than having an old computer sit un-used in your basement,
you can place it in a common area of the house, and hook it up to this app.

It allows the computer to show either the weather outside, a photo slideshow or a view of the day's calendar.

For aesthetics, no keyboard or mouse is required to operate the app. Users can connect their smart phone to the app with a wifi network
as the computer, and they can use a virtual "remote" on their smartphone to direct what content appears on the computer.

<b>How to use this app:</b>
-: Set the computer you wish to use as a display to access the "/display" portion of this application. If you're on a local network, it would be the IP address of the server, followed by the port number, followed by the page location. EG: http://10.0.0.213:3000/display


-: Point the cell phone, tablet, or other mobile device you'll use as the "remote" to the base address. In the example above, this would be : http://10.0.0.213:3000/ Then, you can use the remote to change the display of your information center.
